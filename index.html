                  Dustbins are vital needs of any area because they are a part of cleanliness. Since garbage affects the nature and appearance of the area and the surroundings, it needs to be dealt away with as first as possible. In order to ensure the functionality of the garbage collection and disposal units, garbage cans or dustbins need to be monitored at the collection offices since the overflow of the garbage can lead to pollution, diseases such as cholera among others.
                  Currently. garbage cans are monitored through visiting the places where they are placed each and every time, getting calls from the surrounding personnel’s after which the collectors are able to respond. Due to the increased complaints from the people affected by the garbage over flow problem, they have resorted to disposing the garbage anywhere which is dangerous to their health. 
                  To reduce the problems of garbage overflow a dustbin monitoring system has been developed houses to help notify the garbage collection agencies about the overflow of garbage.
                  The system checks the level of the waste in the bin and then if the bin is full the it sends a notification to the collection center using the Wi-Fi module and then they respond to the system call. The project involved using various data collection methods and tools were data was collected using questionnaires’ and interviews were conducted and implementation was done using embedded systems.
                  In conclusion the main goal was reached and the system has been tested and verified though there were problems which were faced and among which are a lot of activities’ to be accomplished in a very short time period, funding of the system development process and the complexity of the project which led to some changes. Nevertheless we recommended the use of this system to attain help in garbage collection.
